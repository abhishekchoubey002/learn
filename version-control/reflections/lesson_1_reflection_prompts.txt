How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Having a look at the changed contents, indicated by '+' and '-' signs,
    makes it easier to browse the changes instead of having to go through 
    all of it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    As the time progresses, I think it will save a lot of debugging time, so
    that I have time to make more mistakes and learn from them. :-)
 
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    N.A.  Never used Google docs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Saving multiple files in one commit is one way to keep track of changes between
    successive commits. In case if something goes wrong, then we can always go back 
    to the working code or last stable version.
