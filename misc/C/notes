Compile time and Runtime
1. What are the inputs ?
2. What can go wrong ?
3. What is expected output ?

Compilte Time :
1. Source Code, invariants/variants are known.
2. All or any phase of compilation process. (lexical analysis, semantic analysis, optimization problems.)
3. A program that can be run on a machine.

Runtime :
1. We know nothing about the invariants.
2. Logical Errors or bugs causing program to behave abnormally.  (divide by zero (leads to floating point exception))
	. May run out of resources like memory, cpu (stalling).
	. program crashes : due to invalid memory access.
	. Check errors : errors during opening files(file not found, permission denied...)
